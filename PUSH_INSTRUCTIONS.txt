==================================================
  ESTIMATIX - PUSH TO GITHUB INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

✅ Your code has been merged to master successfully!

❌ GitHub is blocking the push due to a Stripe TEST API key
   in old commit history (file already deleted).

==================================================
  QUICK FIX (2 minutes)
==================================================

STEP 1: Allow the Secret on GitHub
--------------------------------------
The browser should have opened this link:

https://github.com/shubhamWithProgram/venkatesh_aluminium/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34JbwvI1nB9kmTR2hvAUyY8GsfR

If not, copy and paste it into your browser.

On that page:
1. Click "Allow secret"
2. Confirm the action

STEP 2: Push Your Code
--------------------------------------
After allowing the secret, run in PowerShell:

    git push origin master

That's it! ✅

==================================================
  WHY THIS IS SAFE
==================================================

✓ It's a Stripe TEST key (sk_test_...), not production
✓ Test keys can't access real payment data
✓ The file containing it (docs/ROUTING_FIXED.md) was deleted
✓ It was only in documentation, never used in actual code

==================================================
  WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED
==================================================

✅ Merged performance-optimization-clean → master
✅ 51 files changed
✅ 14,232 lines added (optimizations)
✅ 1,292 lines removed (cleanup)

Changes include:
- Performance optimization (6.73 MB removed)
- Documentation consolidated (63 files → 1)
- Font files moved to public/
- Unused components deleted
- Build optimized (687 KB gzipped)

==================================================
  AFTER PUSHING
==================================================

Your code will be on GitHub master branch!

Then you can:
1. Deploy to Firebase:
   npm run build
   firebase deploy

2. Share with team
3. Continue development
